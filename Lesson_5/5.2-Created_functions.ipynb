    "def fun_name(arguments):\n",

    "       action 2\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "       action n\n",
    "    return result(s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function is declared using ```def()``` and can contain zero, one or more arguments. If the function contains several arguments, these have to be separated by commas. The name of the function is $fun\\_name$ and it should follow the same rules as the identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the function, different actions are performed, which are written with <u>indentation</u>, and  normally involve operations associated with the input arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, the function may not return results or may return one or several results. The results are returned using the ```return``` statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the function does not pass through ```return```, it returns the result ```None```.\n"
