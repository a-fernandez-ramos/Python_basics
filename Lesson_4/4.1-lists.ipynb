    "## Lists\n",
    "So far, we have seen programs in which to each variable a single data structure was assigned: a string, a number or a Boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is true that this allows generating a multitude of useful programs, when it comes to making more interesting programs, it is usually necessary to group several data under a single variable.\n",
    "In Python there are several ways to do this but, undoubtedly, the most common is through sequences, being the <u>lists</u> and the <u>tuples</u> the most known. Both have many things in common and, in fact, we will see that the main difference lies in their mutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating lists\n",
    "Creating a list of data in Python is as simple as writing them in square brackets:  ```[dato1,dato2,dato3...]```. \n",
    "For instance, to create a list with the first five odd numbers just write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "odd = [1,3,5,7,9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "and to store the ingredients of a delicious Spanish tortilla we write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tortilla = [\"huevos\",\"patatas\",\"cebollas\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Therefore, the lists can be used to store different types of data (integer numbers and strings in the examples). In addition, a list can contain data of different type, such as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    " student = [\"Light Yagami\",17,9.90,True]\n",
    "```\n",
    "that can serve us to store varied information of a student. For example, the first item in the list is a $string$ that tells us the name of the student, the second is a $integer$ with his age, the third one is a $floating$ with his average grade, and the fourth a $Boolean$ indicating whether or not he likes programming (although this element was unnecessary, since all students are passionate about the subject)."
